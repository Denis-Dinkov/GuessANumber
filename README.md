My first small console project called Guess A Number.

Guess A Number" is a game in which your opponent, "the computer" chooses a random number between "1 and 100" and your task is to guess this number. After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number:

## Input and Output
Choose a number between 0 and 100, then press Enter.
The computer selects a **random number**, then returns information whether is **less than, greater than,** or **equal** to the selected **number**.
